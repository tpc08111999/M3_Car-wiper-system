## Introduction
The first windshield wipers were operated manually by moving a lever inside the car. Later wiper designs were powered by the engine's manifold vacuum. Virtually all wipers today employ an electric motor coupled with a linkage mechanism and are actuated by a knob beside the steering wheel.


## Working
-When the button is pressed ONCE, the car will be on ACC mode.
-When the button is pressed TWICE, the car will be on Ignition mode.
-When the button is pressed THREE times, wiper turn on.
-When the button is pressed FOUR times, wiper turn off.
